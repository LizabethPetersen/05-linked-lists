# Lab 05 â€“ Linked Lists and BigO Notation
 
####  Documentation
  * in your README, write documentation for your data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Checklist  
  [x] configure lab directory with correct scaffolding, install node_modules and needed dependencies
  [x] implement a `LinkedList` class which will use a `Node` class that you have also defined
  [x] implement a `pop()` on the LinkedList prototype
  [] implement a `remove(value)` on the prototype
  [] implement `map()` _or_ `reduce()` as pure methods on the LinkedList prototype
  [] in comments above or within each function, note the Big-O time AND space complexity
  [x] write at least two test assertions for each method of your Linked List class
  [x] organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

## Bonus Points (not eligible on resubmits):
  * 1pt: test your Node class as well with at least two test assertions, one for a successful instantiation and another for unsuccessful instantiation
  * 2pts: refactor your Linked List class so `pop()` can have a constant / O(1) run time.
